# Amazon_Scrapper
This Python-based web scraping project collects data from Amazon product pages. The script reads a list of Amazon product URLs from 'amazon_products_urls.csv' and employs concurrent threading to accelerate the scraping process. The information extracted includes product price, title, rating, and technical details. The 'bs4' (Beautiful Soup) library is used for parsing the HTML content, while 'requests' handles HTTP requests. A progress bar displayed via 'tqdm' provides visual feedback during scraping. The script then compiles the collected data into a CSV file named 'output-<current_date>.csv', where <current_date> represents the current date in the format "mm-dd-yyyy." It is essential to adhere to Amazon's terms of service or the terms of any other website being scraped to avoid any potential legal issues.
